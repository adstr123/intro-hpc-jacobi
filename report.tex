1k matrix, 20k iterations
\begin{itemize}
\item Time: 10.91s/130.75s. Changes: N/A
\item Time: 3.27s/53.35s. Changes: Compiler from gcc to icc.
\item Time: 14.37s. Changes: Compiler flag -g, added profiling code to jacobi.c, profiled with pprof --text --lines ./jacobi jgperf.txt. Also had to install gperftools, requiring libunwind. Then installed dot, gv and EPEL for -gv visualisations. First jgperf.txt generated.
\item Line 64 analysed. Looping through data -> data structure issues?
\item Examine data init block. Simplified to 3X3 and worked through using pen and paper. Going through column-wise across a virtual 2D array - jumping across the massive array, terrible for memory. Not contiguous at all.
\item Transposed matrix. Solver time down, overall time up. Profiler says massive amounts of time copying array.
\item Direct solver to solver test: n = 400 w/ transpose: 34.28s/0.78s, n = 400 w/out transpose: 0.79/0.78s. No perf. improvement.
\item Time: . Changes: Rewrote init instead of transposition. Rewrote traversal in run.
